# Practical Applications of AI Chatbots in Drupal
## Florida Drupal Camp February 19, 2022 

This repo contains the slide deck and code for the talk I was supposed to give 
during the conference.  Unfortunately I was unable to present as scheduled -
I had a family emergency and had to return to Jacksonville, Florida Friday
night.  Here is the content of my presentation.
